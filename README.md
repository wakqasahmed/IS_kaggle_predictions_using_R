# IS_kaggle_predictions_using_R
Independent Study on Data Science specifically making predictions using machine learning in R

In this course, I learnt about 'Data Science', 'R Language' and How to make predictions/forecasts using previous/historical data.

While learning, i took part in 2 Kaggle competitions and the result and ranking can be found in the documents available with this repository. The same were submitted as part of my MS partial requirement.
